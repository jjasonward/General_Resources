# PhD Resources

From a STEM and personal perspective (in the UK)

1. Be aware of various Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs), for example see [here](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/research-degrees/funded-research-opportunities-doctoral-training-and-studentships/centres-doctoral) for an overview at UCL.

2. [https://www.findaphd.com](https://www.findaphd.com)  This looks like a great way to do topic-focussed searches, e.g. "quantum information", "Higgs", "photon" etc.  Note postgrad fairs around Oct/Nov time.

## Tips

1. Follow what you enjoy.  If you've enjoyed doing a final year project/masters, think about what factors were behind that, and if those factors align with spending time doing a PhD.

2. Meet some people who are doing a PhD.

3. Think about skills you will pick up.  In the area I was in (experimental particle physics) it was a blend of maths, computing, data analysis, machine learning & algorithms, and collabration/people skills etc. which is a great mixture.

4. Ask your undergrad project advisors who they know and what/where they recommend.  At undergraduate level, you tend to think you are at one University or another and that it's relatively disconnected.  At postrad level and in the research world, everything is deeply connected by multi-institute grants, larger collaborations involving many institutes (including internationally).

5. Think different.  Just because your degree is in one subject doesn't mean you have to stay in the straight and narrow confines of that subject.  In today's very data-driven world, with data spanning nearly all subject areas, there are more chances to cross-fertilise.
